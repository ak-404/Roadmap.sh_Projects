# Basic HTML Website  

This project is part of my learning journey on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The goal of this project is to **structure a website using only HTML**, focusing on different sections like **header, footer, navigation, main content, and sidebars**. Styling will be done in a separate project.   

## Project Overview  

In this project, I created a simple multi-page website using only **HTML**, with the following pages:  

- **Homepage**  
- **Projects**  
- **Articles**  
- **Contact**  

A **navigation bar** is present on all pages, linking to each section for easy access.

## Project Goals  

- Learn how to create **multiple pages** in a website.  
- Structure a website **semantically** using HTML.  
- Organize the structure so that **styling can be added later** without issues.  
- Implement **SEO meta tags** for better search engine visibility.

## Key Features  

✔️ **Semantically correct HTML structure** for better readability and accessibility.  
✔️ **Navigation bar** included on every page for seamless navigation.  
✔️ **SEO meta tags** added in the `<head>` section of each page.  
✔️ **Contact form** with fields for **name, email, and message**.
