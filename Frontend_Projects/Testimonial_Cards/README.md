# Testimonial Cards  

This project is part of my learning journey on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The goal of this project is to **create a collection of testimonial cards** using **HTML and CSS** to practice layout and positioning techniques.  

## Project Overview  

**Testimonials** are quotes or statements from satisfied customers or users and are often used on websites to build **credibility** and **trust**.  

In this project, I created a set of **testimonial cards** using a simple and clean layout. The focus was on using **CSS positioning and layout techniques** to arrange the cards properly and responsively.  

## Key Features  

✔️ **Structured HTML** to organize testimonial content.  
✔️ **CSS layout and positioning** to create visually appealing cards.  
✔️ **Responsive design** to ensure the cards look good on different screen sizes. 

## What I Learned

- How to position elements effectively using CSS. 
- Creating responsive layouts for various screen sizes.  
- Structuring content into reusable components like testimonial cards.
- Enhancing websites with user feedback sections to build trust and credibility
