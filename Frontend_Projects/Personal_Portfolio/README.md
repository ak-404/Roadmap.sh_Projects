# Personal Portfolio 

This project is part of my learning journey on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The goal of this project is to **apply CSS to style a structured HTML website**, making it visually appealing and responsive.  

## Project Overview  

In this project, I took the **Basic HTML Website** I previously created and enhanced its design using **CSS**. The focus was on:  

- Creating a **responsive layout** for different screen sizes.  
- Applying **typography** consistently.  
- Using modern **CSS techniques** like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.  
- Styling the **navigation bar and contact form** for better usability.  

## Key Features  

✔️ **Responsive website** based on the previous HTML structure.  
✔️ **Consistent typography** for a clean design.  
✔️ **Flexbox and media queries** for responsive layouts.  
✔️ **Styled navigation bar** that adapts to mobile and desktop screens.  
✔️ **Well-designed contact form** with properly styled input fields.
