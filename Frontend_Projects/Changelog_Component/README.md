# Changelog Component  

This project is part of my learning journey on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The goal of this project is to **create a simple, well-structured, and responsive changelog component** using **HTML and CSS**.  

## Project Overview  

A **changelog** is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. This component is designed to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.  

The focus of this project was on **positioning and layout** in CSS, ensuring that the component is both **visually appealing** and **responsive**.  

## Key Features  

✔️ **Structured HTML layout** for displaying changelog entries.  
✔️ **CSS for styling and layout**, ensuring a clean and professional look.  
✔️ **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes.  
✔️ **Customizable styles** to fit various website themes.  

### What I Learned  
 
- How to **position and layout** elements using CSS.

- How to create a **reusable component** that can be integrated into a larger website.
